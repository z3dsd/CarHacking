#  Car Hacking Study

Back on 20250302 I was in Japan attending SECCON13 and exploring the interesting event areas.

While walking around, I came across a Car Hacking Village. My first thought was, â€œWhat exactly are they hacking in cars, anyway?"

They handed me a small CAN bus kit used for car hacking CTF. At that point, I had no prior knowledge of automotives, so I had to do due diligence to understand the basics before CTF.

The concept immediately caught my attention. The idea that vehicles could be vulnerable to digital exploitation was just you know fascinating. 

That encounter motivated me to dive deeper into the world of car hacking kinda stuff. I will document my studies to this repository.
